# Markdown formatting

Markdown has no single specification. GitHub Flavored Markdown, CommonMark and every editor's own parser disagree at the edges. The disagreement is silent: the document looks right where you wrote it, and collapses somewhere else.

The rules here are the intersection that renders the same in every common parser. They match the markdownlint defaults, so a document that follows them also passes the gate.

Wording is a separate concern. Sentence rules, structure and vocabulary live in the `technical-writing` skill.

## Blank lines decide almost everything

Most broken Markdown is a missing blank line. A parser needs the blank line to know a block ended; without it, the next block is swallowed into the previous paragraph.

Surround every block-level element with a blank line: headings, lists, fenced code, tables, blockquotes and horizontal rules.

Broken:

```markdown
## Setup
Run the installer.
- download it
- run it
~~~
npm install
~~~
| Step | Time |
| --- | --- |
```

Correct:

```markdown
## Setup

Run the installer.

- download it
- run it

| Step | Time |
| --- | --- |
| download | 1 min |
```

The exceptions are the start and the end of the file, where there is nothing to separate from.

## Headings

- One `#` heading per document, first line of the file. It is the title.
- Descend one level at a time. A `##` never jumps to `####`; the reader and every table-of-contents generator use the levels to build a tree.
- ATX style only: `## Heading`, one space after the hashes, nothing after the text. Setext underlines and closing hashes are a second style, and mixing styles is the most common inconsistency in a repository.
- No trailing punctuation. A heading is a label, not a sentence.
- Headings become anchors: lower-cased, spaces to hyphens, punctuation dropped. `## Set up the gate` is `#set-up-the-gate`. Rename a heading and every link to it breaks silently.

## Lists

Pick one unordered marker and keep it for the whole document. `-` is the safest: `*` collides with emphasis and `+` is rare enough that some editors mishandle it.

Number an ordered list one of two ways, and never both inside one list. Write `1.` on every item where nobody cites the list by number. The source survives reordering, and a diff shows one line instead of a renumbered block. Write real numbers where the text says "rule 5" or "step 3". A reader who greps the source needs to find that number.

Indent a nested list by two spaces, aligned under the text of its parent, not under the marker.

```markdown
- the parent item
  - the child, two spaces in
    - the grandchild, four
```

A blank line before the list and after it. Without the trailing one, the paragraph that follows joins the last item.

A list item that holds more than a line keeps its continuation indented to the same column as the item text.

## Code

Fenced blocks only, three backticks, never indented blocks. An indented block hides in a diff review, and reads the same as a nested list continuation.

Always name the language. It drives highlighting. A linter treats a missing language as an error, because an unlabelled block is a block someone pasted in a hurry.

Use `text` for output that has no language, and `console` or `bash` for a shell session. Where the content itself contains three backticks, fence it with four.

Inline code takes single backticks and no padding spaces: `` `--flag` ``, not `` ` --flag ` ``.

## Links and images

- `[text](url)`. The reversed form `(text)[url]` renders as literal characters in most parsers and as a link in a few, which is worse.
- Link text describes the destination. `click here` and `this link` tell a screen reader nothing and read as noise in a list of links.
- A bare URL in prose is wrapped in angle brackets: `<https://example.com>`. Without them some parsers autolink and some do not.
- Every image carries alt text. `![Coverage badge](badge.svg)`, never `![](badge.svg)`.
- A link to a heading inside the repository uses the anchor form: `[the gate](#the-gate)`.

## Emphasis

`**bold**` and `_italic_`, one style each, consistently. Underscores inside a word break in several parsers, so `snake_case_name` in prose belongs in backticks.

Emphasis is not a heading. A bold line standing alone where a heading belongs breaks the document tree, the table of contents and every anchor link.

## Tables

Tables are where hand-written Markdown fails most often. The full rules, including alignment and the pipe-escaping trap, are in `references/tables.md`. The four that break rendering:

1. **A blank line before the table.** Without it the table is a paragraph.
2. **No blank line inside the table.** A blank line ends it, so every row below renders as literal pipes. The rows look right in the source and the content is silently outside the table.
3. **Every row has the same number of cells.** A short row loses data; a long row is truncated. Count the pipes when a table looks wrong.
4. **The delimiter row needs at least three hyphens per column**, with one space inside each pipe: `| --- | --- |`.

Rule 2 is the one no built-in check catches: `MD055` and `MD056` inspect a parsed table, and an orphaned row was never parsed as one. `assets/rules/table-row-outside-table.js` catches it, and `assets/.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` is what loads it.

```markdown
| Setting | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `timeout` | 30 s | How long one attempt waits |
```

Column widths do not have to line up in the source. The rendered output is the same either way, so write whichever reads better and do not spend a review on it.

## The file itself

- No hard tabs. Tab width varies by editor, and a tab inside a list breaks the indentation the parser expects.
- No trailing spaces, with one exception: two trailing spaces are a hard line break. Prefer restructuring so the break is not needed, and never let an editor strip them silently where they are load-bearing.
- One blank line between blocks, never two.
- The file ends with exactly one newline.
- Inline HTML only where Markdown has no equivalent: `<sub>`, `<sup>`, `<kbd>`, `<br>`. HTML does not render on every surface that shows Markdown.

## Line length

Wrapping is a project decision, and this skill does not impose one. Where prose is unwrapped, one paragraph per line, turn the line-length rule off rather than leave it failing:

```jsonc
"MD013": false
```

A half-enforced rule trains everyone to ignore the linter.

## The gate

`assets/.markdownlint.jsonc` carries these rules as configuration, and `assets/.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` adds the one custom rule beside them. Run both with:

```bash
scripts/lint-markdown.sh docs/
```

The rule numbers behind each section, and what each one catches, are in `references/rules.md`.

## Before committing a document

- [ ] One `#` heading, on the first line
- [ ] Heading levels descend one at a time
- [ ] A blank line before and after every list, fence, table and blockquote
- [ ] Every fence names a language
- [ ] One list marker style, one emphasis style, throughout
- [ ] Every table row has the same cell count
- [ ] No bare URL, no empty link text, no image without alt text
- [ ] The file ends with a single newline
