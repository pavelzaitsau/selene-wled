Use this skill whenever documentation style needs enforcing rather than advising - adding the linter to a repository, writing or tuning a rule, or working out why a rule fired or stayed silent. Trigger it when someone asks to 'check the docs automatically', 'stop people writing X' or 'add a style check to CI'. Do NOT use it for the writing rules themselves, which live in technical-writing, or for Markdown structure, which is markdown-formatting."

# Docs style gate

A convention nobody checks decays within a quarter. Everything a linter can express belongs to the linter, and stops being prose.

The writing rules this gate enforces are in the `technical-writing` skill. This skill covers the machine.

| Enforceable by a linter | Not enforceable, stays in a skill |
| --- | --- |
| Banned words and hedges | Whether a section is complete |
| Vague obligation instead of RFC 2119 | Whether an ADR had real alternatives |
| Sentence length | Whether a fact is in the right file |
| Abbreviations in prose | Whether a comment states why |
| Terminology substitutions | Whether a number is true |

The shipped config in `assets/vale/` is a starting point, not a standard. The shipped config avoids every trap listed below.

## Install

Vale is a Go binary, not a package of your language's ecosystem. Install it separately, or the hook fails to spawn instead of passing silently.

```bash
cp -r assets/vale/.vale.ini assets/vale/styles .
vale --minAlertLevel=error <docs-root>/
```

## Wiring

Pre-commit, in the `local` repo block:

```yaml
      - id: vale-docs
        name: docs style (Vale)
        entry: vale --minAlertLevel=error
        language: system
        files: ^<docs-root>/.*\.md$
```

CI, as a step after the code linter:

```yaml
      - name: docs
        uses: errata-ai/vale-action@reviewdog
        with:
          files: <docs-root>
          fail_on_error: true
```

`scripts/lint-docs.sh` does the same without the action, and exits 127 with an install hint when Vale is absent.

`Docs.Rfc2119` is a warning, not an error, and deliberately so. RFC 2119 keywords belong in normative text only, and the gate cannot tell a specification from a README. An error-level rule here would force `MUST` into every guide.

Errors block. Warnings do not. Put a rule at `error` only when a false positive is worse than the thing it catches never being written.

## Shipped rules

| Rule | Level | Catches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Docs.Hedging` | error | `probably`, `a few`, `tends to`, `in general`, `it seems` |
| `Docs.Filler` | error | `basically`, `essentially`, `obviously`, `simply` |
| `Docs.Rfc2119` | warning | `needs to be`, `we should`, `it is important that` |
| `Docs.NoAbbrev` | error | `cfg`, `pkg`, `msg`, `req`, `resp`, `idx` in prose |
| `Docs.HiddenVerbs` | warning | `performs validation of`, `utilize`, `in order to`, `prior to` |
| `Docs.Passive` | warning | agentless passive |
| `Docs.SentenceLength` | warning | a sentence over 25 words |
| `Docs.Rfc2119Case` | warning | lowercase `must` / `should` where an obligation is meant |
| `Docs.LongDash` | error | an em or en dash anywhere outside code |
| `Docs.Terms` | error | project terminology, empty until the project fills it |
| `Vale.Terms` | error | wrong capitalisation of a proper noun |
| `Vale.Avoid` | error | words listed in `reject.txt` |

## Config traps

Each one costs an afternoon to find.

**`Vale` must be listed in `BasedOnStyles`.** The vocabulary files under `styles/config/vocabularies/` do nothing unless the built-in `Vale` style is enabled. With a project style alone they are dead config that looks like it works.

**`raw` concatenates, `tokens` alternates.** A list under `raw:` is joined into one regular expression, not OR-ed. Two or more alternatives under `raw:` silently produce a pattern that never matches. Use `tokens:` for alternatives.

**Vale uses RE2.** No lookahead, no lookbehind. Express every exclusion as a positive pattern.

**Substitutions do not match across a line break.** A phrase wrapped by the formatter passes the rule. Reflow the paragraph if the rule matters.

**Ignore scopes decide the whole design.** Fenced blocks are excluded by `BlockIgnores`, inline code spans by `TokenIgnores`. Ignore scopes are why a style rule MUST cite the wording it bans inside backticks - otherwise the rule text trips its own rule.

**Spell check is off by design.** `Vale.Spelling = NO`. On a technical corpus it produces more noise than every other rule combined.

## Adding a rule

1. Write the rule under `styles/Docs/`.
2. Write a probe file containing the wording the rule must catch.
3. Write a probe file containing legitimate domain text the rule must NOT catch. **This step is not optional.** A `Filler` rule that bans `just` also flags `just-in-time`, and only the false-positive probe exposes it.
4. Run both probes at `--minAlertLevel=warning`.
5. If the rule encodes terminology, generate it from the project's term list. Never maintain the list and the rule by hand: two hand-synchronised copies drift, and the drift is invisible until someone greps.

## What is deliberately not linted

- Any word that is also a legitimate domain term. List it in the free-words section of the project's term list instead.
- Chat and review comments. The gate covers files.
- Anything a reviewer must judge: completeness, ordering, whether a claim is true.

## Adapting to a project

Fill these four and nothing else. The paths are the shipped ones; after the install step above, the same files sit under `styles/` at the repository root.

1. The routing table, in the contributor guide, with real paths.
2. `assets/vale/styles/Docs/Terms.yml` - the project's terminology substitutions, generated from the term list.
3. `assets/vale/styles/config/vocabularies/Project/accept.txt` - proper nouns and product names, so `Vale.Terms` stops flagging them.
4. `assets/vale/styles/config/vocabularies/Project/reject.txt` - the misspellings this project produces.

The docs root, the severity of each rule and the `NoAbbrev` word list are also project-tunable. Everything else should survive the move to a new repository unchanged.
